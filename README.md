A place for me to easily host one-off projects, scripts, and other tooling often generated via LLMs.

## Elixir Anti-Patterns

I took the 4 Anti-Pattern pages (Code, Design, Process, & Meta-programming) on [hexdocs.pm](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.19.0-rc.0/what-anti-patterns.html) and ran them through https://urltoomarkdown.com/ to convert them to markdown, then cleaned up the formatting and put them into a single file. I use this to critique & review my code as I'm learning elixir, all while only consuming ~20k tokens. Currently taken from the v1.19.0-rc.0 branch, I'll try to update it every so often but they're relatively evergreen.
